# hello-world
exploring, learning, building, 

Trying to gain some knowledge to help myself, and the people around me live the life that they want to live.
Currently interested in OpenVPN and the options that it enables. 
I have just bought a slot over at vultr, and I'm intending to set up a VPN for myself, and my girlfriend who has just started a 3 year course. I chose vultr from a recommendation over at geekshed. 
I am interested in a VPN, because I feel like in the past I have not been in control of my own life, and it seemed at times like my behaviour was not in line with how I would prefer to behave. Or something like that...


Testing. As I have seen github around A LOT. (reference there)

I had no idea that this sort of guide was available: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
I found this guide through vultr irc, after mentioning openVPN, somebody linked me this: https://github.com/Angristan/OpenVPN-install

beep boop
